# Africa-Health-Care-Challenges-Hackthon
This was as Hackthon Hosted by 10nalytics on using data to tackLe and profer solutions to Africa Health-Care Problems

## INTRODUCTION
The lack of access to adequate medical resources and facilities has led to a significant number of deaths. Some of these deaths could have been avoided by timely access to a medical professional or close proximity to hospitals.

## DATASET
An Excel file containing the information below was provided, the data set has information for other continent I had to filter data for Africa continent using the ISO code: 
- Causes of Deaths
- Number of Deaths by Age Group
- Medical Doctors Per 10000 population
- ISO 3166_country and continent-codes list CSV
- World Population
- Health Expenditure(% of GDP)
Some inconsistency in the dataset given might skew the over-all analysis.

## OBJECTIVE
The Objective is to understand the impact of poor access to medical resources and facilities on the continent of Africa with the view to proffering a solution to the problem. 

## ANALYTICS TOOL
All analysis and Visualization was done in Excel You can access the file here []()

## ANALYSIS PROCESS:
I limited all my analysis between 2000 -2019 year period,20 year peroid and I started my analysis process a question

#### WHAT ARE THE CAUSES OF DEATH IN AFRICA?

I dived into the causes of death data to determine whether there is a problem with our healthcare system or whether these deaths are the result of natural causes.

The top five causes of death are cardiovascular diseases, HIV/AIDS, neonatal disorders, lower respiratory infections, and diarrheal diseases. It's also interesting to see that self-harm (suicide) is among the top 20 causes of death; while this is beyond the scope of this project, I believe it's worth investigating in the future.

#### WHAT IS THE TREND OF THE TOP 5 CAUSES OF DEATH IN AFRICA BETWEEN 2000-2019?
I decided to look at the trend of the five leading causes of death between 2000 and 2019.

This shows an interesting trend over the years we can see that cardiovascular disease is on the rise from 2000 to 2019 while there is a drastic drop in death caused by HIV-AID but as we can see, HIV is still one of the top causes of death so it is not time to pull the leg away from the pedal, there is steady drop in death caused by neonatal disorders which shows a good sign if we double our effort to reduce neonatal death.

There isn't much of a difference between lower respiratory infections and diarrheal diseases, which shows that with a little education, we can reduce these preventable diseases significantly

#### DEATH RECORDS BY COUNTRY
I researched countries based on their death records. The following chart depicts the top 20 countries, with the top five highlighted. To better compare countries, the population-to-death ratio must also be considered.

#### TOP FIVES CAUSES OF DEATH 
Decided to check the top five causes of death in the top five countries that recorded the highest death with the goal of developing a practical solution for the top two causes of death in each of these countries with the goal of reducing death by 30% because the top five countries contribute 56% of the death recorded within the top 20 countries that recorded the highest death.

Reviewing and redesigning the current approach used in addressing the top two causes of disease in each of these countries, for example, diarrheal diseases, the leading cause of death in Nigeria, can be drastically reduced by providing clean and safe water to rural areas and continuous public education on the benefits of clean water and safe food consumption. The second cause is malaria. While much work has been done in the prevention of malaria, such as providing free mosquito nets, we must also double down on providing cheap and accessible anti-malaria drugs to people in urban and rural areas. We must use both preventive and cure model to eradicate malaria.

#### DEATH BY AGE-GROUP
I then went on to analyze the death by age-group data; the chart below depicts the trend of death by age group-from 2000 to 2019.

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/420b16c6-01d9-4882-9b8f-a80e45e30398/Untitled.png)

Deaths among children under the age of five are declining while the uptrend of death amongst people aged 70+ can be attributed to old age and declining life expectancy; the concerning data point here is the rise in death rates for people aged 50 to 69.

#### ANY CORRELATION?
 I investigate further to see if there is any correlation between any cause of death and the upward trend of 50- 69 death.

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/348e6053-57ef-4976-943b-9cd0fcad6024/Untitled.png)

 

From this chart above we can see a positive correlation between cardiovascular disease and deaths in the 50-69 age group, both are trending up during the same period. 

According to the IHME Global Burden of Disease, the leading cause of death among people in their 50s is Cardiovascular Disease.

A lot of education about nutrition, lifestyle, and medication is required to reduce and decrease the growing death rate of cardiovascular death in this age group. Because people in this age group are more likely to believe in health professionals, this education should be provided by professionals (doctors, public health specialists, and dietitians). Language barriers are a common issue in Africa, so this education should be provided in a variety of indigenous languages.

#### UNDER FIVE AGE GROUP DEATHS
Despite a decrease in deaths among children under the age of five, the overall death rate remains high. Drilling down, I discovered that only five countries were responsible for 49.61% of all under-five deaths in Africa

If every effort is made to reduce under-5 mortality in these five countries, Africa's under-5 mortality rate will be reduced by 5%. WHO's position is that preterm birth complications, birth asphyxia/trauma, pneumonia, diarrhea, and malaria are the leading causes of death in children under the age of five. All of this can be avoided or treated with access to low-cost health and sanitation interventions.. 

#### PATIENTS TO DOCTOR RATIO
When the number of doctors in Africa and Asia is compared, Asia has 64% more doctors than Africa. I chose to compare Africa and Asia because their populations and socioeconomic indices are so similar. According to this data, Africa lacks health professionals.

This graph demonstrates why Africa lacks doctors; the problem is not a lack of trained doctors; rather, the problem is a brain drain of doctors to Europe and the Arab world in search of better opportunities. The sharp drops in the charts confirm this. It is clear that in order to keep doctors in Africa, we must develop policies that look after their welfare. We should not stop at providing better welfare for doctors; we should also put laws in place to protect their welfare

On another note when we compare the trend of medical numbers to the population of Africa, we can see from the graph below that our population is rapidly growing, but our medical professional number is decreasing year after year. With this negative correlation between the number of trained medical professionals and the population in Africa, many people will die of preventable causes due to a lack of access to medical personnel, as the ratio of patients to a medical doctor is increasing daily. The welfare of doctors should be a priority in every African country, especially countries with high death rate

## CONCLUSION
